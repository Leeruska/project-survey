## Overview

Made this project to learn more about CSS and basic html. I based the project on what I did on FreeCodeCamp excercise, but in that one I mistakenly pressed "submit" before making any CSS. So I wanted to build this again based on that.

### What I learned

I haven't added a background image before, so adding it from my own photos and making it behave as I wanted was a challenge. I got good help from W3schools site: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_background-image.php

I wanted to get the input fields for "Name", "Email" and "Age" to align, and I found te answers in here very helpfull: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10868640/align-html-input-fields-by
I just needed to make the labels for those separated for the labels for the rest or the form, and I did with "class" called "fix".

## Continued development

I still want to get the radio & checkboxes to align with the text, because now it looks like they are on a different level.
Other improvements I would do:
- make a confirmation page after submitting the survey
- get the survey to actually save data somewhere, but that I won't make public for security and safety reasons.
- getting the "Other" input field to be on the same with the label, the fix for the first input fields messed it up...
